Leveling Up App

Project Blueprint: Level Up – Life RPG Tracker

Project Context & Philosophy
- Inspired by Solo Leveling, this project is designed to gamify real-life self-improvement 
by treating tasks like RPG quests and progress like leveling up. 
- The goal is to build consistency and long-term personal growth by tracking daily, weekly, 
monthly, and one-time tasks with a reward and penalty system. 
- Over time, these small actions compound, creating meaningful transformation.

Overall Goals
* A homescreen-level app (desktop dashboard, MacOS 15.5)
* Intuitive and beautiful, checklist-style interface
* Long-term tracking of habits and personal goals
* Visual feedback for progress (XP, level, streaks)
* Built-in accountability through penalties and rewards

Core Components
1. Task Checklist System
* Tasks are grouped by frequency:
    * Daily
        * 10k steps (1xp)
        * Workout (1xp)
        * 150+g Protein (2xp)
        * <2500 Calories (1xp)
        * 20 Minutes Practice Hindi (3xp)
        * 20 Minutes Reading (2xp)
        * Sleep by 12PM (3xp)
    * Weekly
        * Cook something new (10xp)
        * Clean apartment (10xp)
        * Hangout with someone in person (10xp)
        * Catch up with old friend (10xp)
        * Call family for 5+ minutes (10xp)
        * Coffee Chat with someone in industry (10xp)
    * Monthly
        * Go on a hike/trail (50xp)
        * Spend within monthly budget (100xp)
    * One-time
        * First ever handstand push up (500xp)
        * Perform well on deliverable  (200xp)
        * First ever muscle up (200xp)
        * Squat 365 Pounds (300xp)
        * Squat 405 Pounds (500xp)
* Each task has:
    * Name / description
    * XP value
    * Optional tags (e.g. Health, Career, Social)
    * Completion toggle (checkbox)
* Unchecked tasks before “Submit” time are penalized the next day
    * Penalties: e.g., cold shower, extra workout (decided later)


2. Daily Submission Flow
* At night, the user hits a “Submit Day” button
    * All checked tasks are converted to XP
    * Unchecked daily tasks lead to a penalty that will be logged 
    (need 1 unchecked task to unlock small penalty (Vacuum floor) 
    need 2 unchecked tasks to unlock penalty (1 mile run or cold shower next day))
    * Completed weekly/monthly/one-time tasks contribute if they’re completed that day, 
    and will remain checked until it is eligible next. 
* All data is saved (date, what was completed, earned XP, level, etc.)


3. XP & Leveling System
* XP is linear:
    * 100 XP per level
* Daily tasks = low XP (1-3xp)
* Weekly = moderate (~10xp)
* Monthly = higher (10-100xp)
* One-time = major XP (100xp+)
* User gains levels automatically


4. Rewards System
* Rewards are tied to level milestones (e.g., every 10 levels)
    * Example: “Level 10 → $50 to spend on yourself”
    * Rewards can be configured in a list (customizable)


5. Penalty System
* If daily tasks are not completed:
    * Penalties triggered the next day
    * Configurable per user: e.g., “If I don’t finish all dailies, I must run 1 mile tomorrow”
    * Again, unchecked daily tasks lead to a penalty that will be logged 
    (need 1 unchecked task to unlock small penalty (Vacuum floor) 
    need 2 unchecked tasks to unlock penalty (1 mile run or cold shower next day))
* Penalties logged for tracking
* Option to mark penalty as "completed" the next day

6. Customizability/Other screens (optional):
* Task Manager: Add/edit tasks
* Reward Log: History of rewards unlocked
* Stats/Analytics: XP history, streaks, penalty logs

Core Architecture
Data Files (can be JSON at first, upgrade to SQLite later):
* tasks.json: stores tasks and metadata
* progress.json: stores daily logs, XP, levels, penalties
* rewards.json: reward thresholds and statuses

Deployment Plan – Streamlit App + Homescreen Shortcut 
Streamlit
* Uses Python 
* Fast to prototype and easy to modify
* Lightweight web UI with interactive checkboxes and buttons
How To Deploy
1. Build your app in Streamlit (streamlit run tracker.py)
2. Open it in Chrome
3. Go to Chrome menu > More Tools > Create Shortcut
4. Name it (e.g., “Level Up Tracker”), check “Open as window”
5. Drag the new app shortcut to your Dock

Project Timeline
1. Basic UI with checkboxes grouped by task type
2. XP system with level tracking
3. "Submit Day" system: calculate XP, update level, log penalties
4. Penalty logging + reminder system
5. Level-up reward system
